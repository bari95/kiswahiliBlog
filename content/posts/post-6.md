"Mambo" means " things/happenings " . It is plural form of " JAMBO ".

When someone greet you by this "Mambo" , they literally asking you of how are your things going, healthy wise, economic wise etc. The intention is to know your state, your affairs and yourself. 

### The CONTEXT of using " MAMBO "

1. Mambo is a social greeting, it doesn't fit to be used in official setting unless the office has an atmosphere which allow staff to get social to each other.

2. Mambo is mostly used among the youth or at least the people within same age group. Taking this into consideration, you cannot greeting a person who is significantly older than you with this greeting.

3. It's local greeting, hence it's doesn't reveal that you are a foreigner in the first place. Unlike Jambo, which clearly state you are a tourist or foreigner.

### Conversation Example.
 ( Two locals, Zawadi and Juma greeting each other )

JUMA: Mambo Zawadi ?
/
How are you Zawadi ? ( In broader sense, )

ZAWADI: Mambo yangu safi Juma, vipi wewe?
/ my things are going on well Juma, how about you ?

JUMA: Mimi pia, mambo safi kabisa Zawadi, namshukuru Mungu.
/
I too, my thing are going on quite well Zawadi, I thank God

ZAWADI: Vizuri sana Juma, nambie
/
Very nice Juma, tell me...

Conversation continues....
There are many response to 'Mambo' words which are actually meaning the same as " Safi 
Eg.
                     Responses
Mambo >> Safi ( nice )
Mambo >> Shwari ( Serene )
Mambo >> Poa ( Cool )
Mambo >> Fresh ( Cool )

But all these responses are sending the same message that your things are going on well.

NOTE1: When someone greet by saying this " mambo? " It means they ask you all the things they ought to know about you at social level; health wise, economics , if you are student- your studies etc. This is one of the reasons the local Tanzanian use the word " Mambo " instead of " Jambo" , because Mambo is in plural form hence include everything that a person greeting you ought to know.

NOTE2: Also remember, you cannot greet someone who your age gap difference is huge by this "Mambo", because that's will be see as not modest of you and swahili being African has modesty when it comes to greetings.
